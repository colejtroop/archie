# Project state

## Current milestone

Objective Selector V0 neural inference physically built and verified a 3×3 wall in Minecraft Preview on 2026-09-23.

## What works

- Relative blueprint and block-state representation
- Deterministic embodied simulator builds and verifies a 3×3 wall
- Placement retries, comparison, metrics, structured JSONL telemetry
- Optional survival fields from the first agent-state schema
- Sampled/bounded vision records with synchronized privileged labels
- Native Obsidian brain graph summarizes the live policy path with color-coded objective, state, learned features, decision, and action nodes
- Sixteen focused tests pass on a portable Python 3.13.7 runtime; the simulator and live Preview wall runs report exact completion (9/9 blocks)
- Packageable Preview behavior pack spawns a `SimulatedPlayer`, navigates, places via inventory interaction, observes the result, and emits structured chat telemetry
- Live Preview run completed with `BLOCK_PLACEMENT_SUCCEEDED` and `EPISODE_COMPLETED` (`exact_completion: true`, one correct block, zero missing blocks)
- Live Preview multi-block run physically built and verified a complete 3×3 stone wall through nine player-driven placements
- Headless content-log collector converts structured Bedrock events into crash-safe, sequenced JSONL expert trajectories
- PyTorch Objective Selector V0 inherits deterministic expert target selection across 15,024 valid wall states; held-out accuracy is 99.63% raw and 100% with physical-validity masking
- Objective Selector V0 weights export to Bedrock JavaScript; live Preview inference selected policy actions `0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12` and completed all nine physical placements with zero failures or retries
- The verified neural Preview episode is recoverable from the content log as a 58-event JSONL trajectory
- Live Preview content-log telemetry now drives the simplified Obsidian brain graph while recording the same episode

## Decisions

- Keep Python core independent of Bedrock details through `Environment`.
- Use Bedrock GameTest `SimulatedPlayer` for the first live body: navigation and item-on-block APIs produce physical actions; reset/fixtures may use direct world editing.
- Use the beta channel versions reported by the running Preview manifest loader (`2.12.0-beta` and `1.0.0-beta`). Fully qualified `.28` package versions are rejected in the pack manifest.
- Treat privileged state as V0/V1 ground truth and labels, never as the permanent perception contract.
- Store no raw frames by default. Recording must be enabled, sampled, and capped.
- Keep learned scope explicit: Objective Selector V0 chooses the next supported blueprint cell; it does not yet control navigation, placement, or visual perception.

## Commands

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
archie-neural-graph --vault "C:\path\to\your\ObsidianVault"
```

## Constraints

- Validation currently uses a temporary portable Python 3.13.7 runtime because no system Python is installed.
- `@minecraft/server-gametest` is currently experimental/pre-release and may require Preview or a compatible BDS build.

## Immediate next step

Human-verify the live Preview-to-Obsidian graph connection, then add synchronized first-person visual capture without removing privileged V0 labels.
